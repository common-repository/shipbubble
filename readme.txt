**Shipbubble: The Shipping Solution that Works for You**

We all know logistics is the backbone of any successful e-commerce business. You've already got enough on your plate to make sales and drive growth—your shipping shouldn’t be another challenge. Yet, too often, it can feel like the one thing that slows everything down. From assigning logistics companies to tracking packages and dealing with endless customer questions, shipping can take way longer than expected, eating out of the time you have to focus on scaling your business.

But what if shipping could work in your favour, not against you? What if every order could move as smoothly as your business should?

**With Shipbubble, you can:**

* **Automation that saves time:** Imagine a world where you don’t have to manually assign couriers or track every shipment. With Shipbubble, that’s the reality. Our platform automates the entire shipping process, from order placement to delivery. We handle the logistics by matching your orders with the best logistics companies, so you don’t have to. Creating time for you to focus on what’s important—growing your business.
* **Real-Time Tracking for Your Customers:** We know the questions: “Where’s my order?”, “When will it arrive?” These constant interruptions can slow down your day. With Shipbubble’s real-time tracking, your customers stay informed every step of the way. They’ll see where their order is and when it’s arriving—no need to ask you. This means fewer distractions for you and more satisfaction for them.
* **Cut costs and save resources:** Your time is valuable. So is your money. With Shipbubble, you don’t need a large team to manage shipping processes. Our platform does the work for you, so you can scale without needing to add extra manpower. This means less spending on unnecessary resources and more money in your pocket.
* **All in one platform:** We understand the chaos of juggling multiple orders at once. That’s why we designed Shipbubble to be clean, intuitive, and incredibly easy to use. No more hopping between tabs, managing spreadsheets, or navigating cluttered interfaces. Everything you need is organised in one place.
* **Personalised business analytics:** You get actionable insights into your business operations from your shipping insights that help you make infrared decisions.
* **Multiple delivery options:** Your customers can pick the type of delivery and the delivery price that works best for them. They can get same-day delivery or choose an estimated delivery timeline.

**Courier companies we are partnered with -** DHL, UPS, Redstar, Redstar Express, GIG, FedEx, Aramex, Speedaf, Dellyman, FEZ, Kwik and so much more.
